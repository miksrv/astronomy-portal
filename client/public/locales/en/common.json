Our observatory operates autonomously and allows you to take pictures of deep space objects. The goal of this project is to make astronomy accessible to everyone. Therefore, the observatory is open to everyone - anyone can use it to get images of space. In the near future, a free telescope control service will be launched on this site.",

Since then, every season our team has been organizing free astronomical lectures in the open air. We go out of town with telescopes, hold astrolectures, and organize sidewalk astronomy evenings. The goal of the project is to create accessible astronomy for everyone. We bring space closer!",
        "stargazing-description-1": "Our project \"Look at the Stars\" has attracted a wide audience from the very beginning. We strive to awaken interest in space among children, teenagers, and adults by showing them its grandeur and mystery. The main idea is that everyone can enjoy the night sky and be inspired by the wonders of the Universe through our astronomy evenings and astro trips.",
        "stargazing-description-2": "Our events cover not only the cities and towns of the Orenburg region but also neighboring regions. We organize field trips to remote places where there is no strong light pollution, allowing us to observe the stars in all their glory. Our team of astronomers, volunteers, and scientists is always ready to share their knowledge and experience so that everyone can better understand and love astronomy.",
        "stargazing-description-3": "One of the key components of the project is the lectures given by experienced amateur astronomers. We talk about scientific discoveries, the history of astronomy, and its modern achievements. The lectures not only expand the knowledge of the audience but also inspire further study of this amazing science. We conduct all lectures in a simple format, explaining complex things in simple terms.",
